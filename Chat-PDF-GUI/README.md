# 💬 Ask Your PDF

A simple Streamlit web application that allows you to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with OpenAI and FAISS to provide answers based on the document's context.

## ✨ Features

  * **PDF Upload:** Easily upload any PDF file.
  * **Text Extraction:** Automatically extracts text from the uploaded PDF.
  * **Text Chunking:** Splits the document into manageable chunks for accurate retrieval.
  * **Vector Embeddings:** Creates vector embeddings using OpenAI.
  * **In-Memory Vector Store:** Uses FAISS for an efficient, in-memory vector search.
  * **Q\&A Interface:** Ask questions and receive answers generated by an LLM, based *only* on the document's content.
  * **Cost Tracking:** Monitors and prints the OpenAI API token usage for each query to the console.

## 🚀 How It Works

This application follows a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow:

1.  **Upload & Process:** The user uploads a PDF. The application extracts the text and splits it into smaller chunks.
2.  **Embed & Store:** Each text chunk is converted into a numerical vector (embedding) using OpenAI's embedding model. These vectors are stored in a FAISS vector database that lives in the app's memory.
3.  **Retrieve:** When the user asks a question, the app embeds the question and searches the FAISS database for the most semantically similar text chunks from the original PDF.
4.  **Generate:** The retrieved chunks (the "context") and the user's question are passed to an OpenAI chat model (like GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo) with a prompt that instructs it to answer the question using *only* the provided context.
5.  **Display:** The generated answer is displayed to the user in the Streamlit interface.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.9 or later
  * An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### 2\. Clone the Repository

(If you have this project in a repository)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivanshgupta2504/AI-Projects.git
cd Chat-PDF-GUI
```

### 3\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

You can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

**`requirements.txt`**

```
streamlit
python-dotenv
PyPDF2
langchain
langchain-openai
langchain-community
faiss-cpu
```

Then, install them all at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the packages manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv PyPDF2 langchain langchain-openai langchain-community faiss-cpu
```

### 5\. Set Up Environment Variables

The application uses a `.env` file to manage your API key securely.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.

2.  Add your OpenAI API key to this file:

    ```ini
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretAPIKeyGoesHere"
    ```

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application using the Streamlit CLI:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a local web server and open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
